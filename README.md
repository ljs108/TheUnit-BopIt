See ya around.

Hello Fellas:

My name is Ryan Estatico and I am also an EE. I like weekends and smashing exams! I ate left over walking tacos today. It was dissapointing.

Come to class on Monday!


Greetings!

I am Will Sneathen. I am an EE major at Pitt.  I enjoy playing guitar, cooking, and being exactly on time to class.  I had a Slim Jim on the drive back to school, which was a terrible decision.

Thanks for reading.
